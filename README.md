## VPN Benefits

* Encrypts internet traffic to prevent monitoring.
* Hides IP address and physical location.
* Access to blocked websites and geo-restricted content.
* Secures data on public Wi-Fi.

## VPN Limitations

* Reduced internet speed due to server encryption overhead.
* Free VPNs have data caps, limited locations.
* Cannot ensure 100% anonymity (ISP/VPN logs, browser fingerprinting).
